# The Rust Programming Language Workshop in the Fu Foundation School of Computing

## Why we develop this workshop?
The Rust Programming Language workshop is an opportunity to learn a powerful new language that offers a range of features and benefits. Rust is a modern language that has been designed with safety, performance, and reliability in mind. With a focus on features such as memory safety and data-race-free concurrency, Rust enables developers to create programs that are more secure and reliable. The Rust Programming Language workshop is designed to provide users with the tools and knowledge to create high-performing, reliable applications. Additionally, Rust is a language that is easy to learn, and provides a great platform for developing robust applications. With its focus on safety and performance, Rust is a language that is becoming increasingly popular for developing secure and reliable applications.

## Rust Book by Brown University
The Rust Book by Brown University is the source material for this workshop and provides a comprehensive overview of the Rust Programming Language. It covers topics such as memory safety, data-race-free concurrency, and performance. The Rust Book by Brown University is a great resource for developers who are just starting out with Rust, as well as experienced developers who want to take their Rust skills to the next level.
